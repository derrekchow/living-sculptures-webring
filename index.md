Living Sculptures Webring

Welcome to a webring by the students of Living Sculpture, a seminar at Universität der Künste Berlin as part of the Time-Based Art with Contemporary Technologies class.

The seminar ran over the winter semester 2024-25. It focused on open systems-oriented art practice. We looked at biological and computational processes in and as artworks, while applying a holistic view to life and sculpture as part of an expanded ecosystem, including experimentation in scientific and technological contexts. Over the course of the semester, we listened to the sounds of microbial life, visited an ‘alt’ cybernetics library, received a talk about ikebana, and experienced a selection of live, living, time-based artworks, among other things. Some of the key readings discussed ‘neural media’, an approach to high-dimensionality suggested by K Allado-McDowell and ‘symbiontics’, a term introduced by Caroline A. Jones that connects the ontic, or “what is” to symbiosis, the condition of “with-living.” A central topic of concern were the possible forms of artisthood at a time when technology permeates every aspect of our lives, within the expanding and differentiating fields of art, and amidst planetary and humanitarian crises.

For their seminar work, the students were asked to create instructionals, or scores for ‘living sculptures’. Future artworks ranging from realistic to fantastical that would be presented as a collection of online entries linked together in a circular structure: sculptures.live! Additionally, a series of silk screen printed posters was made to promote this web publication. The works in the webring range from poetry to code, from tools to instruments, from games to exercises, from scripts to recipes—and everything in between. They include works based in time and time travel; attempts at inter- and intraspecies communication; skins, bones, and ghosts. Reflecting the ways in which the seminar took interest in the boundaries of knowledge, I hope experiencing the participants’ works will make both sense and nonsense.

# Contributor Bios

**Arbor** is an artist and researcher using light as a medium. He creates experiential works in the form of novel interfaces and light-based artifacts and performances in a variety of contexts and environments.

**Diego Behncke**'s work is realized through the frameworks of fictional systems, abstraction, and synthesis. Taking form through obfuscation operations involving installations, synthetic sound, and films, his works appear as an abuse of conceptual and technical byproducts, a foregrounding of epistemic faults, and a strategic misdirection of ambiguity.

**Stratos Bichakis**' artistic work centers on experiential installations and performances that transform human senses through digital technologies. He develops artistic tools and instruments, to explore the emotional and transcendent possibilities of sound, light, motion and language.

**Ying Chen**'s work explores media, communication tools, emotions, and human consciousness through new media, installation, and video. Initially focused on these relationships, her practice shifted after recovering from social anxiety. Now, she examines personal emotions in relation to nature, collaborating with non-human beings to explore coexistence within the universe.

**Shu Chon** explores human existence and how life and art intersect, correlate, and interchange throughout a person's lifespan. Their work engages with both auditory and visual perception, while also exploring other sensory experiences through the body. Through their practice, they create a medium that connects living beings with the abstract world.

**Linden Derichs** is studying computer science as well as new media art, interested in topics such as emotion and technology, media archeology, queer online cultures and digital intimacy and dealing with them through interactive installations and web art. He doesn’t like to think of his work as only an individual’s creation, and love for it to be woven into collective subconsciousness rather than exhibited. It is a tool for him to speak fully, to be felt in a mind that makes verbal communication fail him at times. To accept ghost like being in the digital realm and hold space for the endless loss and misunderstanding that is acting, wanting, and moving forward to all.

**Philipp Dollinger** is a mixed media artist, who is living and working Berlin. Through the means of technology, such as 3D software, film, sound design and painting he researches the interconnectedness of society, technology and nature through a queer-feminist perspective.

**Johann Edelmann** design’s interactive installations that blend light, sound, and technology to create engaging experiences, inviting viewers to rethink their reality. This concept explores how AI and sensory technology could translate plant intelligence into something perceptible, imagining a world where moss could communicate with us.

**Clemens Fischer** is a German artist born in New Jersey, USA. Through an experimental approach, he questions the current creation and consumption of images by creating automata which use various analogical devices. Clemens Fischer sidesteps the digital medium by taking a stance that gives pride of place to chance, humour and surprise.

**Eva Ingver** is a Uruguayan born multidisciplinary artist interested on movement and an extended understanding of ecosystems, where technology is part of natural ecosystems, and cultural syncretism represent interactions within an ecosystem. She works around performance, installation, video, and sculpture.

**Selenay Kiray** is a Berlin-based artist and researcher working at the intersection of sound, materiality, and biopolitics. With a background in political science and sound studies, her work explores the acoustic and tactile dimensions of perception, often engaging with organic and technological materials.

**Júlia Koffler** is a vocalist, vocal coach and sound artist from Hungary. Her work is informed by vocal research, an interest in timbre and technology, and the relationship between voice and its varied cultural articulations, taking shape through different formats such as installation, video, spatial audio pieces, and performance. Her live shows comprise a use of voice, tape and electronics to explore how vocal expression and its technological mediation unfold in a spatial setting.

**Leo Lou** explores the delicate interplay between living and non-living, organic and artificial. His work delves into unseen interactions and symbiotic entanglements, reflecting on how living beings, technology, and their shared environment coalesce as an interconnected whole.

**Marie Luhmann**’s work explores the moving image in experimental cinematic forms. Her installations project images onto various materials and incorporate spoken word as well as text. Her current project examines the significance of darkness in cities during the winter months, understanding it as part of a symbiotic system that reflects the relationships between humans, nature, and darkness.

**Esteban Pérez**'s multidisciplinary work situates his research in specific contexts and involves collaboration with human and more-than-human entities to create images, sounds, objects, and installations. His work explores alternate modes of attention to relate to the more-than-human world, informed by Latin American science fiction and Andean epistemologies.

**Yujin Song**‘s work explores a feeling of aliveness and spatiality. Through alternative narratives within the moving image genre, she experiments with non-human perspectives to free her thoughts from a dominant human-centric viewpoint. Recently, her research has shifted toward examining how marginalized beings within urban structures experience both isolation and connection, as well as visualizing the trace of interactions between humans and non-human beings.

**zouzou** is a wanderer, drifting through diverse fields and territories. Their work explores the unconscious and existence, unfolding in whatever medium suits the journey. Rooted in a pursuit of adventure and intense emotions, their practice seeks to forge connections across the self, others, time, memory, and the world.
